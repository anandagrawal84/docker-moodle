# TODO List

Cause I don't use Taiga, Trello or any other places for project management quite yet...

## In Progress

[ ] - travis-ci integration
[ ] - figure out way to download extensions without extending image each time (Go Binary, build Docker image yourself?)

## Completed

[x] [Kubernetes Manifests - moved to own branch @ github.com/jbkc85](https://github.com/jbkc85/moodle-kubernetes-tutorial)

## Deprecated

[x] mkdocs.yml - not needed at this time
